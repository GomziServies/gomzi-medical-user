This fragment is specifically designed to target fat loss without affecting other GH functions like muscle growth or bone development. It works by increasing the rate at which the body burns fat (lipolysis) and reducing fat accumulation in fat cells, especially in areas like the abdomen, hips, and thighs. HGH Fragment 176-191 does this by increasing the activity of enzymes involved in fat breakdown and preventing the formation of new fat cells.",
